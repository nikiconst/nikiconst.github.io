          <h1>Analysis of tourism arrivals in Cyprus</h1>

        <h5>The aim of the project</h5>
        <h6>Tourism is one of the most critical sectors of the Cyprus economy, contributing substantially both directly
          and indirectly to the country’s GDP. The aim of the project is to analyse in more detail the Cyprus tourist
          sector through an examination of its contribution in the country’s GDP as well as examination of relevant
          statistics for tourist arrivals in an attempt to identify changes and trends over the past 10 years. The
          country of origin of tourists visiting Cyprus as well as the revenue per visitor is also examined with the aim
          of identifying the most critical countries from where tourists come from as well as changes in the average
          spending per tourists. </h6>

        <br>

        
          <div id="text">
            <h6>The number of tourist arrivals in Cyprus has a direct positive effect on Cyprus’ GDP growth. It can be
              observed from the graph below that when the number of tourists visiting Cyprus increases, its GDP rises as
              well and vice versa. This is because tourism affects a variety of different sectors. For example, it can
              be
              included in sectors such as “Accommodation & food service”, “Electricity & Water supply”, “Wholesale &
              retail
              trade” and “Transportation & storage”.
              Specifically, according to the “World Data Atlas” tourism contributes for about 23% of the whole country’s
              GDP.</h6>
            <br>
            <p>Figure 3: The comparison between the number of tourist arrivals and the revenue they bring</p>
            <div class="chart" id="Chart27"></div>
            <p>Figure 4: Revenue per tourist</p>
            <div class="chart" id="Chart24"></div>
            <h6>Tourists bring many benefits with them when arriving in Cyprus. The main benefit being the revenues they
              bring within the economy through their spending during their visit. It is calculated that a tourist
              visiting
              Cyprus in 2019 spent about €675</h6>
          </div>

            <p>Figure 5: Europe & Russia map showing the number of tourist arrivals in Cyprus by country of origin</p>
            <div class="chart" id="Chart29"></div>
            <h6>Tourists in Cyprus come from many different countries, while Europe being the main source of tourists. From
              the map above it is observed that the majority of visitors come from the UK (1,330,635 visitors in 2019),
              followed by Russian visitors (781,856 visitors in 2019).</h6>
          </div>
        

        
          <div id="text">
            <h6>As the UK historically appears to be the most critical market for Cyprus tourism there is further analysis
            to
            consider whether the UK economic conditions (such as GDP growth and the exchange rate) could be one of the
            reasons for changes in UK tourist arrivals in Cyprus.</h6>
            <br>
            <p>Figure 6: UK 's GDP growth in comparison with the number of UK citizens visiting Cyprus</p>
            <div class="chart" id="Chart30"></div>
            <p>Figure 7: The Euro to Pound exchange rate over time</p>
            <div class="chart" id="Chart31"></div>
            <br>
            <h6>As shown from the graph above it is observed that UK’s GDP affects the number of UK tourists in Cyprus when
              there are significant changes in the GDP, such as the 4.51% decrease of UK’s GDP occurred in 2009. Such a
              fall
              resulted in a 13.96% decrease of UK tourist arrivals in Cyprus. However, following the year 2009, despite
              the
              fact that GDP remained stable over the years, the number of tourist arrivals fluctuated. This seems that the
              Euro:Pound exchange rate may have a more significant effect on the number of UK tourist arrivals in Cyprus.
              During the year 2015 onwards, GDP seemed to remain stable at a rate of 2%, whereas, there seems to be a
              significant appreciation of the pound and an increase of UK visitors in Cyprus.</h6>

        <!--Conclusion-->

        
          <div id="text">
            <h5>Conclusion:</h5>
            <h6>In conclusion, it can be realized that tourism plays a major role in Cyprus’ economy in terms of its GDP
              including the income received. However, it is realized that other country’s economies have a significant
              effect on Cyprus’ economy since it affects the number of citizens leaving their country of origin in order
              to visit Cyprus.</h6>
            <br>
            <h5>Challenges:</h5>
            <h6>In order to complete this study json and html language has been used.
                During the study no major problems have occurred when scraping, handling and visualizing the data. Minor
                problems like creating the map and trying to visualize all countries correctly, while their names having to
                appear the same as in the dataset. I dealt with these problems by having to draw each country by hand in
                detail and having to enter their names manually.
                Additionally, a problem occurred during data cleaning was that the years of the pandemic were not accurately
                representing the tourist arrivals in Cyprus and their effect on the economy since they ceased from
                travelling.
                Therefore, I have decided to emphasize on the year 2019 since it is a more representative year for the
                number
                of tourist arrivals in Cyprus. This is because in later years during the pandemic the number of tourist
                arrivals has decreased significantly since people have ceased from travelling.</h6>
