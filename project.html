          <h1>Analysis of tourism arrivals in Cyprus</h1>
        </div>

        <br>
        <div id="text">
          <h4>Aim of the project</h4>
          <h6>Tourism is one of the most important sectors of the Cyprus economy, contributing significantly directly
            and indirectly to the country’s GDP. The aim of the project is to analyse the Cyprus tourist sector through
            an examination of its contribution to the country’s GDP as well as examination of relevant statistics
            relating to tourist arrivals over the past years. The country of origin of tourists visiting Cyprus as well
            as the revenue per visitor is examined with the aim of identifying the most critical countries from where
            tourists come from, possible factors that may affect the inflow of tourists from these countries as well
            changes in the average spending per tourist. </h6>
        </div>


        <div id="text">
          <h5>Figure1: Cyprus GDP growth(%) and percentage change in tourist arrivals</h5>
          <div class="chart" id="Chart22"></div>
        </div>
        <div id="text">
          <h5>Figure2: Sectors contribution to Cyprus’ GDP</h5>
          <div class="chart" id="Chart23"></div>
        </div>

        <div id="text">
          <h6>As can be seen from Figure1 when the number of tourists increases, GDP rises as well and vice versa. This
            is because tourism affects a number of different sectors both directly such as “Accommodation & food
            service”, “Wholesale & retail trade” as well as indirectly like, Real Estate, for example through the
            building of hotels and Financial Services for example banking.</h6>
          <h6>Specifically, according to the “World Data Atlas” tourism contributed in 2019 for about 23% of the whole
            country’s GDP.</h6>
          <br>
          <h5>Figure3: Number of tourist arrivals and revenue from tourism </h5>
          <div class="chart" id="Chart27"></div>
          <h5>Figure4: Revenue per tourist</h5>
          <div class="chart" id="Chart24"></div>
          <h6>Tourism is important when considering also revenue contribution. As can be seen from Figure4 a tourist
            visiting Cyprus in 2019 spent on average €675 while there seems to be a downward trend from previous years.
          </h6>
        </div>



        <div id="text">
          <h5>Figure5: Number of tourist arrivals in Cyprus by country of origin </h5>
          <div class="chart" id="Chart29"></div>
          <h6>Tourists come from different countries, with Europe being the main source. From the map it appears that
            the majority of visitors come from the UK(1,330,635 in 2019), followed by Russian visitors(781,856 in 2019).
          </h6>
        
          <h6>As the UK historically appears to be the most critical market for Cyprus tourism, there is further analysis
            to consider whether the UK economic conditions(such as GDP growth and the exchange rate) could be one of the
            reasons for changes in UK tourist arrivals.</h6>
          
          <h5>Figure6: UK’s GDP growth in comparison with the number of UK citizens visiting Cyprus</h5>
          <div class="chart" id="Chart30"></div>
          <h5>Figure7: Euro:Pound exchange rate</h5>
          <div class="chart" id="Chart31"></div>
          <h6>As shown from Figure6 UK’s GDP affects the number of UK tourists when there are significant changes in GDP
            such as in 2009. However, despite the fact that GDP remained stable after 2009, the number of tourist
            arrivals fluctuated. The fluctuations in tourist arrivals seem to be more affected by the Euro:Pound
            exchange rate than the economic conditions. For example, during the period 2015 onwards, GDP remained stable
            while, there seems to be an appreciation of the pound and an increase in UK visitors. </h6>
        </div>


        <!--Conclusion-->


        <div id="text">
          <h4>Conclusion:</h4>
          <h6>As observed from the analysis, tourism is a major contributor to Cyprus’ GDP and has a direct effect on
            Cyprus’ overall economy. Revenue from tourism has remained high and important, despite the drop in the
            average spending per tourist over the past years. UK has been the major source of tourism with the exchange
            rate being one of the most important factors affecting the flow of tourism from the UK. </h6>
          <br>
          <h4>Challenges:</h4>
          <h6>Most of the data came from the Cyprus Statistics department and had to be assessed and cleaned as regards
            relevance and periods under review. There have been challenges in cleaning the data as there was a need to
            scrape off extra data included in the dataset that were not required or were not relevant. For example,
            there was extra data for the euro:pound exchange rate such as daily, monthly, annually and quarterly values
            which had to be deleted as well as very granular information on the sectors of the economy which had to be
            grouped together to produce less granular result for the GDP break down. </h6>
          <h6>Another challenge was when creating the map and trying to visualize all countries correctly, while their
            names had to appear the same as in the dataset. This has been dealt with by having to draw each country by
            hand in detail and having to enter their names manually. </h6>
          <h6>Additionally, given the pandemic, post 2020 data were not used as they did not reflect normal conditions
            which compromised the analysis as there were no recent data to comment on. Therefore, the emphasis was on
            2019 since it is a more representative year for the number of tourist arrivals in Cyprus. However, as many
            habits and conditions have changed after the pandemic and bearing in mind new political events like the war
            in Ukraine and sanctions against Russia, the historic data on Cyprus tourism and the analysis of such data
            relating prior to 2019 may not be so relevant to be used to make predictions for the future and analyse
            behaviours in a predictive manner. </h6>
